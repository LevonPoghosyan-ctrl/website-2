4. **Understanding Potential Risks**:
Along with AI’s incredible potential comes the need to address ethical and societal concerns. Statistics like how many jobs may be automated or how AI impacts privacy and data security can guide responsible development. This helps frame debates about regulations, fairness, and transparency in AI systems.
